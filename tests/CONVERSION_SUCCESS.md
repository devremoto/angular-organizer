âœ… **TARGETED CONVERSION TEST RESULTS**

## Your Original Code:
```html
<app-tree-view
    *ngIf="hasChildren(node) && isExpanded(node)"
    [data]="node.children || []"
    [level]="level + 1"
    (nodeSelected)="nodeSelected.emit($event)"
    (nodeDeleted)="nodeDeleted.emit($event)"
    (nodeAdded)="nodeAdded.emit($event)"></app-tree-view>
```

## Converted Result:
```html
@if (hasChildren(node) && isExpanded(node)) {
  <app-tree-view
    [data]="node.children || []"
    [level]="level + 1"
    (nodeSelected)="nodeSelected.emit($event)"
    (nodeDeleted)="nodeDeleted.emit($event)"
    (nodeAdded)="nodeAdded.emit($event)"></app-tree-view>
}
```

## âœ… **CONVERSION SUCCESS:**

1. **Structural Directive Converted**: `*ngIf="hasChildren(node) && isExpanded(node)"` â†’ `@if (hasChildren(node) && isExpanded(node)) {`
2. **Element Preserved**: The `<app-tree-view>` tag and all its attributes were maintained exactly
3. **Attributes Intact**: All property bindings `[data]`, `[level]` and event handlers `(nodeSelected)`, `(nodeDeleted)`, `(nodeAdded)` preserved
4. **Targeted Conversion**: Only the specific element at cursor position was converted
5. **Multi-line Support**: Correctly handled element spanning multiple lines with attributes
6. **Hyphenated Tags**: Successfully handled hyphenated element name `app-tree-view`

## ðŸŽ¯ **USAGE:**
Right-click on any line within the `<app-tree-view>` element and select "Convert Angular Control Flow" from the context menu. The extension will convert only that specific element while leaving all other code unchanged.

The targeted conversion is working perfectly! ðŸš€
